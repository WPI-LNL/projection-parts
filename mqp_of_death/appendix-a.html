<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The WPI Lens and Lights club was formed in 1962 to facilitate the need for 
motion picture projection on the campus of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, 
Massachusetts.  Starting with a pair of Simplex Carbon-Arc 35mm projectors, the student-run club 
projected movies weekly in Alden Hall on campus.  In 1989, WPI and the WPI Lens and Lights Club 
received a pair of Norelco Todd-AO AA-II Xenon-Arc 35mm/70mm motion picture projectors as a gift 
from the National Amusements Corporation.  While the WPI Lens and Lights club has expanded to cover 
audio and lighting needs of the WPI community and beyond, motion picture projection remains the 
foundation on which they build.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, the WPI Lens and Lights Club is contracted by the WPI Social Committee 
to project movies every week in Perreault Hall.  A Head Projectionist, who is elected by the Lens and 
Lights Club, is in charge of all motion picture operations at WPI.  The Head Projectionist is in 
charge of training and sponsoring new projectionists.  Once trained, a projectionists in training is 
sent to the Department of Public Safety to complete his/her projectionist examination.  If the 
examination is passed, s/he becomes licensed and is allowed to work at movie theaters around the state.</P>
