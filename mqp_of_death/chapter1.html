<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motion picture projectionists in professional movie theaters often show films using only one motion picture projector.  This is most often because commercial movie theaters own what is called a <I>platter system</I>.  A platter system allows projectionists to splice all of the reels of a movie together and run one big reel of film through the projector.  WPI however, does not own a platter system and splices two 20-minute shipping reels together to form 40-minute reels.  Thus, projectionists must switch from one projector to the other, or changeover, in the middle of a movie (every 40 minutes).  If done correctly, this will be unnoticeable by the average moviegoer, yet it requires a lot of work on the part of the projectionists.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the work involved with a changeover may be eliminated by a semi-automatic changeover system.  Such a system would allow one projectionist to run a movie, rather than the two or three required now.  A semi-automatic system would be able to stop a projector and changeover the sound from one projector to the next.  For safety reasons, I decided not to develop a system which would automatically start a projector.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system to be developed consists of a display mounted on the sound rack which alerts the projectionist of any malfunctioning systems and monitors the current status of the systems in use.  It will display which projector is running, where the sound is being read from, which projector is arced up, etc.  This system allows one projectionist to better monitor the status of the equipment being used during a show.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My reason for conducting this project is to help projectionists, mainly at WPI, to know the status of the equipment and help detect problems once they arise.  I hope that this will make motion picture projection at WPI easier than it currently is.  A status system and semi-automatic changeover system will make training new projectionists easier and hopefully keep more people involved in the art of motion picture projection. My specific objectives of my project are:</P>

<OL>
<OL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Assess the current use of automated systems in projection facilities in the  Worcester area.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Determine what projectionists are using to address safety and automation concerns in their theaters.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Understand how a semi-automatic system could be used to help projectionists address safety concerns as well as make motion picture projection easier.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Assess what systems have and have not worked in the past.  As part of this assessment, I will interview projectionists at various movie theaters in the Worcester area.</LI></P>
</OL>
</OL>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve these objectives, I will conduct interviews with local projectionists (both from commercial theaters in the Worcester area and also from the WPI Lens and Lights club) and managers from various Worcester-area movie theaters to determine what systems are currently in use and what has been done to address safety concerns which have arisen.  I will also determine what projectionists would like to see in an automation and status display system for motion picture projectors. I will interview projectionists either in person or over the telephone.  Using the information from the survey results, I will analyze the data and develop a set of recommendations for my automation and status display system.  Based on my findings, I will determine what projectionists would like to see in future status and automation systems.</P>
