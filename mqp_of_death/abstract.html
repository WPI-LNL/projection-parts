The purpose of my project was to develop, design, and implement a projector control system, 
for use on the 35mm/70mm motion picture projectors located in Perreault Hall.  Using VHDL, 
I programmed an Altera chip, which controls and monitors the vital systems of the projectors, 
such as the motor, arc lamp, exciter lamp (for reading the sound off the film), shutter, projector 
door, and changeover.  During an emergency or malfunction, the control system shuts down the 
affected systems automatically.
