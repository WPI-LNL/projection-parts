<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important things that needs to be present in any system is user feedback.  Without user feedback, the user of the system has no idea if the system is working properly, if at all.  In the old configuration of the projection booth, there was almost no user feedback.  If a movie was playing at a decent volume in the booth, there was no way of telling what equipment was on and functioning properly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The user interface to the system is also very important when planning out the design of a system.  If it is difficult for the user to input commands or receive feedback, then the interface is useless.  I designed my system so a projectionist would be able to easily input commands (select sound formats or override an automatic setting) and easily receive feedback from the main control system mounted on the sound rack (the status of each projector's systems).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part placement is very important in a system.  If the parts that a user needs to interact with are out of reach or in an inconvenient location, they are useless.  For this reason, I placed the different parts of my system based on the following criteria:  ease of use, usability, visibility, ease of repair, and convenience.  If the projectionist needs to bend over and reach under the arc house to change the sound format, then my auxiliary control box is not doing its job, because the projectionist could have remained upright and walked over to the soundrack to change the sound.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the parts in the system also need to be usable and easy to learn.  If it takes a new or even an experienced projectionist weeks to learn the new system, it is not worth it.  The design needed to be intuitive and resemble something that projectionists at WPI can relate to. For example, the layout of my auxiliary control box follows a logical order. The switches for the sound format selection are arranged in numerical order as follows:  16mm, 35mm, 70mm, CD player, Mute.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the projectionist cannot see the indicating lights on the control systems, then the indicators are not doing their job.  Visibility is probably the most important aspect of this design.  The projectionist and anyone else operating equipment in the booth, needs to be aware of the current state of the equipment, as indicated by the main control system and auxiliary control systems.  The second that these indicators are out of view,  the projectionist is back to where he/she was prior to the implementation of my control system.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the event of an equipment failure, the faulty part needs to be replaced as soon as possible, as to ensure no interruptions in the film.  Parts need to be easy to repair or even replace.  If a part is critical (ie, it is required for the projectors to function), it should not be located in a hard-to-reach place.  All of the relays I installed are very easy to get at, if need be.  The components I used are common in the electrical and computer engineering industry, making replacements very easy to come by.  I also mounted my IC chips in sockets.  If a chip fails, it can easily be replaced with one of the spares,  without soldering.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, convenience plays an important role in designing my system.  If my system was not convenient, then there would be no point in my system.  The original goal of my project was to make motion picture projection at WPI a little easier than it was, and also help alert the projectionists to any problems that arise during the showing of a film.</P>
